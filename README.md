# CNSM 2025: A Protocol-Based Framework for AI Lifecycle Management in 6G via NWDAF
An work about *AIasServ-LifeCycle*


# NWDAF AI-as-a-Service ‚Äî Formal Specification (TLA+)

This repository contains the **complete, executable TLA+ model** that accompanies the short paper

> **‚ÄúA Protocol-Based Framework for Distributed AI Lifecycle Management in 6G via NWDAF‚Äù**  
> (submitted to IEEE CNSM 2025).

The model formalises the two service-based interfaces proposed in the paper‚Äî**MTCP** (Model Training & Creation Protocol) and **MEP** (Model Execution Protocol)‚Äîand demonstrates, via the **TLC** model checker, that they satisfy the key safety and liveness requirements claimed in the manuscript.

# Verified properties

| Property                | Type      | Meaning in protocol terms                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NoStaleLoad**         | Invariant | An NF never loads a model that has already been *retired*. |
| **DeadlockFreedom**     | Invariant | The system always has at least one enabled transition.     |
| **EventuallyPublished** | Liveness  | Every model marked *valid* is eventually *published*.      |
| **EventuallyFeedback**  | Liveness  | Every inference triggers feedback eventually.              |


‚úÖ Temporal Properties Verified
This TLA+ specification defines and verifies eight temporal properties using the TLC model checker. These properties fall into two categories: safety (ensuring nothing bad happens) and liveness (ensuring something good eventually happens).

üîí Safety Properties
ExactlyOncePublication
Ensures that a given modelURI is published at most once during the execution lifecycle.

NoStaleLoad
Guarantees that a model previously tagged as retired cannot be loaded by any Network Function (NF).

DeadlockFreedom
Ensures that the system never reaches a deadlock; at least one transition is always enabled.

üîÅ Liveness Properties
EventuallyPublished
Asserts that every MTCP request issued by an NF eventually leads to a published model.

EventuallyFeedback
Ensures that every MEP inference operation is eventually followed by a metric report (MEP-Report).

üß© Auxiliary/Structural Properties
AlwaysEventuallyValidState
Asserts that the system eventually reaches a stable state that satisfies all defined invariants.

NoDuplicateModelURI
Ensures that model URIs are unique and cannot be reused in future publications.

ProgressForEachNF
Verifies that all registered NFs progress through the expected model lifecycle phases (intent ‚Üí publication ‚Üí inference).


# Scaling the constants

To explore larger scenarios, edit MTCP_MEP.cfg:
```text
CONSTANTS
  NFs        = {nf1, nf2, nf3, nf4, nf5}
  Versions   = {v1, v2, v3}
  startModel = v2
```

# Relation to the paper

Section V-A (Formal Verification) of the manuscript cites this artefact.
The TLC statistics (states, depth) match those reported in Table IV of the camera-ready version, confirming reproducibility.
